# Hunter

[中文](https://github.com/Leaking/Hunter/blob/master/README_ch.md)

Hunter is a framework to develop android gradle plugin based on 
[ASM](https://asm.ow2.io/) and [Gradle Transform API](http://tools.android.com/tech-docs/new-build-system/transform-api).
It provides a set of useful, scalable plugins for android developers. You can use Hunter to develop more plugins
to monitor your app, enhance 3rd-dependency, enhance android framework. Plugins based on Hunter support incremental and concurrent compile, so you don't need to
afraid of extra build time.

## Some useful plugins based on Hunter

 + [OkHttp-Plugin](https://github.com/Leaking/Hunter/blob/master/README_hunter_okhttp.md): Hack Okhttp to set a global Interceptor/Eventlistener/Dns
 for all your OkhttpClients, even clients in 3rd-party library.
 + [Timing-Plugin](https://github.com/Leaking/Hunter/blob/master/README_hunter_timing.md): you can time all your ui-thread methods, and dump the block traces with costed-time of every step, you also can consume the block detail in your way.
 + [Debug-Plugin](https://github.com/Leaking/Hunter/blob/master/README_hunter_debug.md): you can simply add a annotation to a certain method, and the method will print all parameters and costed time, return value. It has some advantages over JakeWharton's [hugo](https://github.com/JakeWharton/hugo)
 + [LogLine-Plugin](https://github.com/Leaking/Hunter/blob/master/README_hunter_logline.md): you can add a line number into every lines of your logcat


## TODO
